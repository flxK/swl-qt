**Note:** if you want to report a bug, most likely you want to do that in
https://github.com/springweblobby/swl-website/issues and not in this repo,
unless you know the bug is in the C++ part.

Weblobby C++ system API
===========

This component provides lower level system API for JavaScript code in
https://github.com/springweblobby/swl-website such as filesystem access,
loading and calling unitsync functions, launching processes, etc. This API
should be kept reasonably minimal with most of the application logic residing
in JavaScript.
