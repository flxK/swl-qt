Compile Qt:
configure -opensource -confirm-license -prefix /home/user/build -no-rpath -qt-xcb -system-proxies -nomake examples -fontconfig

Use the cursor patch on the qt source tree. (Although it's possibly not needed
with newer XCursor versions - need to check)

It's important not to have gstreamer headers so that qwebkit compiles without
gstreamer support. Otherwise it will bring in unnecessary gst libs.

When collecting libs be sure to include pr-downloader as it depends on
libcurl.so.4 and not libcurl-gnutls.so.4, the former is often not present.
