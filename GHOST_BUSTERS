This is a compilation of bugs that have workarounds but have largely unknown
cause. The idea is that someday someone with some spare time on their hands
(i.e. no one) will look into them and figure out what's actually going on.


= GHOSTS OVERWRITING BUFFER =

Something overwrites the buffer in UnitsyncHandler::jsReadFileVFS() on my
machine. Read the implementation of the function for a short essay on the
subject. That's by far the weirdest bug in the list.

= GHOSTS MURDERING GSTREAMER =

On linux on my machine trying to use gstreamer in the main app fails even if
you put the gstreamer code in main() and don't initialize QT at all. Currently
there's a workaround with a secondary app being used to play sounds.
