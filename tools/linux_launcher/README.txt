Next to this file you have the "lib" folder that contains various
libs that weblobby depends on and the actual executable, a
desktop file dubbed "Run Weblobby" and the launcher script
eponymously named "weblobby".

You need to run the launcher script at least once before you can
use the desktop file. In case you don't know how to do that, you
have to open the terminal and type the full path of the script,
e.g. if you extracted this into a folder named swl in your home
directory you need to run:
/home/your-username/swl/weblobby

After that the desktop file should work, so you can use that if
you want.
